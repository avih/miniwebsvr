	- Applied a patch from Helc`Ainu to provide Linux port with thread
	  pool support.
	- Minor alterations to patch to fix race condition, and exit on flag
	- Re-patched the patched patch (phew!) Helc provided me with some good
	  advice on the mistakes I have made.
	- After that, and resolving a possibly unnessesary sleep got a ~15%
	  speedup!

Tue Feb 13 2007 Daniel Walker <djwalker at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Fixed some errors with parsing % in URLs

Tue Feb 13 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Implemented more comprehensive sub-root protection

Fri Feb 9 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Pthread implementation is working fine now
	- Released version 0.0.6

Thu Feb 8 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Range requests(download resuming) is fully functional
	- Started implementing pthreads support

Wed Feb 7 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	- HTTP/1.0 style "Range" requests are implmented and tested
	- Added a ton of debug info

Sat Feb 3 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	- MiniWebSvr now handles range errors properly
	- #ifdef _DEBUG then prints out headers as debug info...

Fri Feb 2 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Added initial support for Thread Pools
	- Added initial support for Range-Based downloads
	- Changed polling back to 1 second

Wed Jan 24 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Got single threaded server to work on Linux
	- Implemented Address reuse (for Linux to ignore TIME_WAIT state)(to
	  re-listen the server quickly)
	- Disabled Nagle, as it interferes with our own buffering algorithm

Tue Jan 23 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Started port to UNIX sockets
	- Got single-threaded listener to work
	- GET "201 Created" types currently fail
	- OPTIONS HEAD and GET (file) works.
	- Fixed a few API misuses (for both Windows/UNIX)

Thu Jan 18 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	Released version 0.05
	- Fixed a bug in server_readln where it would return an array that is 
	  one character too long. The problem was hidden because the buffer
	  start out as zeroes.
	- Supports conditinal GET's 
	  If-Modified-Since: Using string comparison (Based on the assumption the client stores the string)
	  Tested & works with Firefox, Konqueror & IE. Opera is not playing nice, not even requesting an 
	  If-Modified-Since on forced refresh, and it's cache never expires.

Tue Jan 16 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Fixed up the indentation
	- Added OPTIONS
	- Added HEAD
	- Moved GET/HEAD logic to own file

Mon Jan 15 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Made directory listing look more like Apache
	- strl(cpy/cat) strnlen implementations are now optinally inlineable
	- Added option to limit listening to one specified interface only

Fri Jan 12 2007 Nickolas Girgoriadis <grigi_@sourceforge.net>
	- Went through all code trying to locate and fix possible buffer
	  overflow problems, I fixed over twenty.
	- While I was at it, I optimized some routines and flow, esp reducing
	  the no of string scans
	- Implemented output Buffering, so that header will get sent with some
	  data appended (one packet) versus about 6-9 packets.
	- Blocked the 'nul' virual file device (in windows), it would open a
	  write only file as readable, then (if you are lucky) the kernel will
	  kill the rogue process attemting to allocate an infinite amount of
	  ram.
	- With the improvements, a generic nikto scan over a wireless & lan
	  network (simulate ~10ms latency), the scan time went down from 2 minutes
	  to 14 seconds, and over a GigE link dropped from 20 seconds to 11
	  seconds.
	- Requests a second over wireless went up from ~200/s to ~500/s, GigE
	  does ~700/s, and local went up from ~900/s to ~1150/s

Thu Jan 11 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	Reports Date and Last-modified date in response header
	Was parsing % in URL twice, Joined implementation
	Several potential buffer overruns fixed
	Imported strl(cpy/cat) for os'es that doesn't have it in libc (faster & more secure)
	Fixed a possible race condition with signal handling

Wed Jan 10 2007 Daniel Walker <djwalker at users.sourceforge.net>
	You can now set the document root using the --root parameter
	miniweb no parses URL's better, it now copes with % and ?
	a potential bufer overrun has been fixed
	it was possible to bypass the sub-root protection by typing GET ./

Wed Jan 10 2007 Daniel Walker <djwalker at users.sourceforge.net>
	Added support for command line parameters

Mon Jan 01 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	Released version 0.04
	Catches signals and exits gracefully
	Added logging
	Added configuration framework
	Focused on reducing bugs and memory leaks

Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	Released version 0.03
	Miniweb now plays better with the OS
	Threaded, too ;)

Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	Released version 0.02

	Parses % in URL correctly

Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
