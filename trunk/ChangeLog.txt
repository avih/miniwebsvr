Sat Jun 16 2007 Daniel Walker <djwalker at users.sourceforge.net>

	  advice on the mistakes I have made.

	  re-listen the server quickly)

Tue Jan 23 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>

	  one character too long. The problem was hidden because the buffer
	  start out as zeroes.

	  If-Modified-Since: Using string comparison (Based on the assumption the client stores the string)
	  Tested & works with Firefox, Konqueror & IE. Opera is not playing nice, not even requesting an
	  If-Modified-Since on forced refresh, and it's cache never expires.

Fri Jan 12 2007 Nickolas Girgoriadis <grigi_@sourceforge.net>
	- Went through all code trying to locate and fix possible buffer
	  overflow problems, I fixed over twenty.
	- While I was at it, I optimized some routines and flow, esp reducing
	  the no of string scans
	- Implemented output Buffering, so that header will get sent with some
	  data appended (one packet) versus about 6-9 packets.
	- Blocked the 'nul' virtual file device (in windows), it would open a
	  write only file as readable, then (if you are lucky) the kernel will
	  kill the rogue process attempting to allocate an infinite amount of
	  ram.
	- With the improvements, a generic nikto scan over a wireless & lan
	  network (simulate ~10ms latency), the scan time went down from 2 minutes
	  to 14 seconds, and over a GigE link dropped from 20 seconds to 11
	  seconds.
	- Requests a second over wireless went up from ~200/s to ~500/s, GigE
	  does ~700/s, and local went up from ~900/s to ~1150/s
