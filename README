Welcome to the MiniWebsvr project
---------------------------------

MiniWebsvr is a small web server that aims to be able to be used stand-alone
or embedded into another application.
Small footprint and light on resources is a requirement.

The web-server supports the following:
- Serves static web pages
- Directory listing
- Supports HTTP MIME encodings
- Supports GET/HEAD/OPTIONS
- Logging to disk
- Small memory footprint
- Muti-threaded
- Written in plain C
- Currently Win32 only
- Command line options
- Conditional GET:
  -  If-Modified-Since:


Was originally designed as a small stand-alone web-server, but I think I'll
change the scope to a small embedded web serbver, so maybe serve pages to
browsers to support an game, maybe provide live stats of the game world
(would be usefull for an online game) or used for downloading in-game content
to a client. So eventually it will be an embedded HTTP server.
