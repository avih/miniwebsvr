MiniWeb Helper Library

To be true to the "Mini" in MiniWebSvr, I have decided to split the
functionality.

MiniWebSvr will only be the server, have the configuration and serving hooks,
BUT NOTHING ELSE! Also MiniWebSvr is only allowed to be a C application.

For the rest: (e.g.)
- The XML parser/generator
- Common utilities
- Resource management
- Template system (which I am going to start on right NOW)

These will be in another library MWH (MiniWeb Helper).

The MWH set of tools can be C/C++.

Initially I recommend that each of these components be developed in
"stand-alone" format.

Once MiniWebSvr as a library is capable of doing the required things for a
library like this to be useful, I'll start creating MWH as a library under
/trunk/mwh, And also alter the Makefile to accommodate the users.

MiniWebSvr MUST NOT have any dependencies on MWH.
MWH SHOULD NOT have any dependencies on MiniWebSvr.

This would allow each to be used separately.
Glue can be provided in a separate file that "links" the two libraries
together. (Sample code?)
