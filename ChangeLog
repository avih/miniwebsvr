Still Planned:
Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	Released version 0.05
	Reports Date and Last-modified date in response header.
	Added config option for the web "root"
	Added support for request type HEAD
	Supports conditinal GET's (If-Modified-Since:)


Done:
Mon Jan 15 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	- Made directory listing look more like Apache
	- strl(cpy/cat) strnlen implementations are now optinally inlineable

Fri Jan 12 2007 Nickolas Girgoriadis <grigi_@sourceforge.net>
	- Went through all code trying to locate and fix possible buffer
	  overflow problems, I fixed over twenty.
	- While I was at it, I optimized some routines and flow, esp reducing
	  the no of string scans
	- Implemented output Buffering, so that header will get sent with some
	  data appended (one packet) versus about 6-9 packets.
	- Blocked the 'nul' virual file device (in windows), it would open a
	  write only file as readable, then (if you are lucky) the kernel will
	  kill the rogue process attemting to allocate an infinite amount of
	  ram.
	- With the improvements, a generic nikto scan over a wireless & lan
	  network (simulate ~10ms latency), the scan time went down from 2 minutes
	  to 14 seconds, and over a GigE link dropped from 20 seconds to 11
	  seconds.
	- Requests a second over wireless went up from ~200/s to ~500/s, GigE
	  does ~700/s, and local went up from ~900/s to ~1150/s

Thu Jan 11 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	Reports Date and Last-modified date in response header
	Was parsing % in URL twice, Joined implementation
	Several potential buffer overruns fixed
	Imported strl(cpy/cat) for os'es that doesn't have it in libc (faster & more secure)
	Fixed a possible race condition with signal handling

Wed Jan 10 2007 Daniel Walker <daniel.john.walker@gmail.com>
	You can now set the document root using the --root parameter
	miniweb no parses URL's better, it now copes with % and ?
	a potential bufer overrun has been fixed
	it was possible to bypass the sub-root protection by typing GET ./

Wed Jan 10 2007 Daniel Walker <daniel.john.walker@gmail.com>
	Added support for command line parameters

Mon Jan 01 2007 Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	Released version 0.04
	Catches signals and exits gracefully
	Added logging
	Added configuration framework
	Focused on reducing bugs and memory leaks

Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
	Released version 0.03
	Miniweb now plays better with the OS
	Threaded, too ;)

Nickolas Grigoriadis <grigi_ at users.sourceforge.net>
